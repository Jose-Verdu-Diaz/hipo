	"content": "Welcome to HIPO What is HIPO? HIPO (or Hyperion Image PrOcessing) is a toolset for organizing, processing and analyzing Hyperion tissue images. HIPO is aimed to users without an IT or programming background (go to Principles for more information), and it is in a very early, fast-paced development stage. New releases are published weekly and novel features are constantly being added.\n"

	"content": "HIPO is being developed with 2 main principles in mind:\nez2use \u0026amp; ez2dev HIPO is aimed to researchers without any IT or programming background. This means that the toolset must be as easy to install, setup and use as possible. At the same time, HIPO is being developed actively by one single person (José Verdú Díaz), which limits the amount of work that can be made. Furthermore, this project shall focus on creating new and useful features as actively as possible. Then, HIPO must also be easy to develope to enable fast implementation and experimentation.\nAll this places HIPO in a tradeoff between being ez2use and ez2dev. The tool lacks a graphical user interface and is used from the terminal, avoiding the extra effort that this implies but also renouncing some usability.\nFree and Open HIPO is and will remain free to use, copy, adapt and distribute as long as its License is maintained.\n"

	"content": "You will need Python and some modules to use HIPO. If you are not an experienced user you will find detailed instructions in the Environment section. Otherwise, feel free to jump to the Source Code section.\nEnvironment It is recommended to use Conda for installing Python and the required modules. From Conda documentation:\n Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. Conda quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, loads and switches between environments on your local computer. It was created for Python programs, but it can package and distribute software for any language.\n In other words, conda allows you to create \u0026ldquo;virtual environments\u0026rdquo; where you can install Python and modules. You can create as many environments as you like, and they are all independent between each other and your machine. This way you can have environments running different Python and module versions, and you can cleanly remove all modules from your machine by just removing the environment.\nConda is provided through Anaconda and Miniconda. Miniconda is a minimal version of Anaconda, including only the essentials for creating and managing Python environments. To install it, go here and select the option that best suits your machine.\nAfter installing conda, open a terminal. If you use Windows, you may open a terminal by pressing Windows Key + r, entering cmd in the input box and pressing Enter. After opening the terminal, enter conda -V you should see something similar to the following:\n$ conda -V conda 3.7.0 If the conda command is not found, you might not have conda in your PATH variable. Refer to the following article for detailed instructions.\nOtherwise, you are ready to create an environment for HIPO! To do so, enter conda create -n hipo python.\n$ conda create -n hipo python Collecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): done Solving environment: done ... Proceed ([y]/n)? When you are asked to proceed, enter y. After installing the environment, activate it with conda activate hipo. The terminal will update to display that the environment is active.\n$ conda activate hipo (hipo)$ You may deactivate the environment anytime by entering conda deactivate.\nNow you are ready to install all required modules. Enter, one-by-one, the following commands. Yo will be asked to confirm after each one.\n conda install pandas conda install pillow conda install tifffile conda install matplotlib conda install seaborn conda install -c conda-forge seaborn-image conda install tqdm conda install -c conda-forge napari conda install -c conda-forge tabulate  Your environment is now ready to run HIPO! In the next section you will find how to download the source code.\nSource Code You can download the source code in two ways:\n (RECOMMENDED) Download the latest stable release Clone or download HIPO\u0026rsquo;s repository, if you want to test the latest unreleased (and unstable) features.  Note that this documentation will always refer to the latest release. HIPO is currently in a very early, fast-changing development stage, so this documentation might not apply to older releases.\nAfter obtaining the source code, uncompress it into a folder and and navigate to it with the terminal. If you are not familiar with navigating through a terminal, refer to the following article (Windows) or the following article (MacOs). When you are located in the HIPO folder, and with your environment active, enter python main.py. If you see the welcome output, congratulations, you finished setting up HIPO!\n(hipo)$ python main.py @@ @@ @@@@@ @@@@@@ @@@@@ @@ @@ @@@ @@ @@ @@ @@ @@@@@@@ @@@ @@@@@@ @@ @@ @@ @@ @@@ @@ @@ @@ @@ @@ @@@@@ @@ @@@@@ *@@o.oO@@@@@@@@@@@Oo.o@@* o@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@o .@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@. °@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@° .°. @@@@@@@ .°. o@@@@@@@##@@@@@@@##@@@@@@@o O@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@O @@@@@@@ *@@@@@@@@@@@* @@@@@@@ @@@@@@@@@@..@@@@@@@@@@@..@@@@@@@@@@ @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ *@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@* °@@@@@@@@@@o°° °°o@@@@@@@@@@@° °oOOo° °oOOo° Hyperion Image PrOcessing Press Enter to continue...
